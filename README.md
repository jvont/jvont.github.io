# jvont

Welcome to the repo for my site at http://jvont.github.io!

Page is very much a work-in-progress, the ultimate goal is to create a simple static site for hosting my resume and showcasing projects I've worked on.

## about the site

This site uses [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) for static site generation. To build, simply run:

```Python
python generator.py
```

and the complete static source will be built to the `build/` directory.
